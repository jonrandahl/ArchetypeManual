## Features at a Glance ##
Archetype can do many things but most people will only need a few features provided below:

### Basic ###
* Create groupings (fieldsets) of installed data types
* Enable/disable fieldsets or delete them
* Sortable fieldsets
* Validation
* Allow for zero or more fieldsets
* Enforce a maximum number of fieldsets
* Hide property labels for more screen space
* Toggle collapsing behavior
* Clone fieldsets

### Advanced ###
* Multiple types of fieldsets mixed together
* Add custom CSS
* Add custom JS
* Switch the view altogether
* Enable route hijacking by your server side code 
* Disable the built-in property value converter so you can implement your own

## Use Cases ##
The best use case for Archetype occurs when you need a short list of collapsible fieldsets that contain other installed data types.  The best concrete example would be using hero sliders:
